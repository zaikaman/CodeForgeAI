# Feature Specification: CodeForge AI - Multi-Agent System for Automated Code Generation

**Feature Branch**: `001-codeforge-ai-multi-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a full-stack TypeScript project called CodeForge AI â€“ a multi-agent AI system for automated code generation, reviews, and enhancements, powered by the ADK-TS framework. A virtual dev team for solo developers."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a solo developer**, I want an AI-powered virtual development team that can generate, review, and enhance code based on my specifications, so that I can accelerate development while maintaining code quality without managing a full team.

**Workflow**:
1. Developer initializes CodeForge AI on their project repository
2. Developer provides a feature description (e.g., "Build a React component for user authentication with hooks")
3. System analyzes existing codebase for context
4. Multiple AI agents collaborate to generate scaffolded code
5. Agents automatically review the generated code through multi-perspective analysis
6. System presents code with review feedback, diffs, and confidence scores
7. Developer can iterate, apply changes, or request enhancements

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new project repository, **When** developer runs onboarding command with repo path, **Then** system scans codebase, creates embeddings for context, and saves project configuration

2. **Given** onboarded project, **When** developer requests code generation with prompt "Create Node.js API endpoint for user signup", **Then** system generates complete code with tests, performs auto-review, and outputs formatted code with review summary in under 30 seconds

3. **Given** existing code file, **When** developer runs review command on file, **Then** multiple specialized agents analyze code for bugs, security, performance, and best practices, outputting actionable feedback with severity ratings

4. **Given** reviewed code with identified issues, **When** developer runs enhance command with goal description, **Then** system generates optimized version with diffs showing specific improvements

5. **Given** generated code output, **When** developer uses apply flag, **Then** system writes code to specified file or generates patch file for review

6. **Given** interactive web UI session, **When** agents generate code, **Then** developer sees real-time streaming of agent "thoughts" and can interject with modifications mid-generation

7. **Given** VS Code with CodeForge extension, **When** developer selects text and triggers generation command, **Then** system parses selection as prompt and inserts generated code at cursor position

8. **Given** batch mode with multiple prompts, **When** generation completes, **Then** system outputs summary table showing status for each file (generated/reviewed/failed) with aggregate metrics

### Edge Cases

- What happens when API rate limits are reached during generation?
  - System should queue requests, show progress, and fall back gracefully with cached/local processing
  
- How does system handle ambiguous or conflicting specifications?
  - Debate resolver agent mediates conflicts, system may prompt user for clarification before proceeding
  
- What happens when generated code fails tests or review?
  - System automatically triggers refinement cycle (hallucination check), reverts if unrecoverable, flags for manual intervention
  
- How does system handle unsupported languages or frameworks?
  - System detects from prompt/file extension, either processes with best-effort generic approach or clearly indicates unsupported with graceful error
  
- What happens when external integrations (GitHub/SonarQube) are unavailable?
  - System logs "External disabled" warnings and continues with local-only analysis without blocking core functionality
  
- How does system handle very large codebases during onboarding?
  - Progressive scanning with chunking, priority on recently modified files, background embedding generation with progress indicators
