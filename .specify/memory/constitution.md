# CodeForgeAI Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

**All code MUST meet the following non-negotiable quality requirements:**

- **Readability First**: Code is written for humans to read and machines to execute. Clear naming, consistent formatting, and self-documenting code are mandatory. Clever code that sacrifices clarity is prohibited.

- **Maintainability**: Every module MUST be independently understandable without requiring deep system knowledge. Maximum function complexity of 15 cyclomatic complexity; functions exceeding this MUST be refactored.

- **Documentation Requirements**: 
  - All public APIs MUST have complete docstrings/comments
  - Complex algorithms MUST include explanation comments
  - Architecture decisions MUST be documented in ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

- **Code Review Mandate**: No code reaches production without peer review. Reviewers MUST verify adherence to all constitutional principles before approval.

- **Static Analysis**: All code MUST pass configured linters and static analyzers with zero warnings. Suppressions require documented justification.

**Rationale**: Technical debt compounds exponentially. Enforcing quality standards from day one prevents the "we'll fix it later" anti-pattern that never materializes. Code is read 10x more than written; optimize for the reader.

### II. Testing Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all features:**

- **TDD Workflow**: Tests MUST be written → User approved → Tests MUST fail → Implementation begins → Tests pass → Refactor. This cycle is strictly enforced.

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - Contract Tests: 100% of all API contracts MUST have contract tests
  - Integration Tests: All user-facing workflows MUST have end-to-end integration tests
  - Unit Tests: Critical business logic MUST achieve minimum 80% code coverage
  - Edge Cases: All error conditions and boundary cases MUST be explicitly tested

- **Test Quality Standards**:
  - Tests MUST be deterministic (no flaky tests)
  - Tests MUST run in isolation (no shared state between tests)
  - Tests MUST fail for the right reason (test the behavior, not implementation)
  - Tests MUST execute in under 100ms each for unit tests

- **Testing Gates**: No feature is "complete" until:
  - All tests pass consistently
  - Coverage thresholds met
  - Performance tests validate requirements
  - Manual quickstart validation successful

**Rationale**: Tests are executable specifications that document intent, catch regressions, and enable fearless refactoring. TDD ensures testability is designed in, not bolted on. Without rigorous testing discipline, system reliability degrades rapidly.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**Every user interaction MUST provide a consistent, intuitive experience:**

- **Interface Consistency**:
  - Patterns established in one feature MUST be reused throughout the system
  - CLI commands MUST follow consistent naming conventions (verb-noun structure)
  - API endpoints MUST follow RESTful or GraphQL conventions consistently
  - Error messages MUST be actionable and user-friendly

- **Feedback Requirements**:
  - Operations MUST provide immediate feedback (loading states, progress indicators)
  - Long-running operations (>2 seconds) MUST show progress
  - Errors MUST explain what went wrong AND how to fix it
  - Success states MUST be clearly communicated

- **Accessibility Standards**:
  - All interfaces MUST be accessible to users with disabilities
  - CLI output MUST be parseable by screen readers and scripts
  - Visual interfaces MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
  - Color MUST NOT be the only means of conveying information

- **Documentation for Users**:
  - Every feature MUST include user-facing documentation
  - Examples MUST be provided for common use cases
  - Error messages MUST reference relevant documentation

**Rationale**: Inconsistent UX fragments the user's mental model, increases cognitive load, and degrades trust. Every friction point drives users away or generates support burden. UX consistency is a force multiplier for adoption and satisfaction.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**Performance is a feature; all code MUST meet defined performance budgets:**

- **Response Time Budgets**:
  - API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms at p95 under normal load
  - CLI commands MUST complete in under 1 second for interactive operations
  - UI interactions MUST provide feedback within 100ms (perceived responsiveness)
  - Batch operations MUST process minimum 1,000 items/second

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Memory usage MUST NOT exceed 512MB for typical workloads
  - CPU usage MUST NOT exceed 50% on target hardware under normal load
  - Startup time MUST be under 2 seconds for CLI tools
  - Database queries MUST use indexes; no full table scans on tables >1,000 rows

- **Scalability Standards**:
  - All designs MUST consider horizontal scalability
  - Stateless services required; no in-memory session storage
  - Database transactions MUST be minimized in duration
  - Caching strategies MUST be defined for frequently accessed data

- **Performance Testing**:
  - All performance-critical code paths MUST have benchmark tests
  - Load testing MUST validate system behavior at 2x expected peak load
  - Performance regression tests MUST run in CI pipeline
  - Performance metrics MUST be tracked over time

**Rationale**: Performance problems are difficult to fix retroactively and often require architectural changes. Setting performance budgets early forces efficient design. Poor performance directly impacts user satisfaction, operational costs, and system reliability.

## Quality Gates

**All features MUST pass the following gates before merging:**

1. **Constitution Compliance**: Feature design reviewed against all four core principles with documented justification for any complexity.

2. **Code Quality Gate**:
   - Static analysis passes with zero warnings
   - Code review approved by at least one peer
   - Cyclomatic complexity within limits
   - Documentation complete

3. **Testing Gate**:
   - All TDD tests written and passing
   - Coverage thresholds met
   - No flaky tests introduced
   - Performance tests validate budgets

4. **UX Gate**:
   - Consistent with existing patterns
   - Error messages actionable
   - Documentation updated
   - Accessibility verified

5. **Performance Gate**:
   - Response times within budget
   - Resource usage within limits
   - Load testing passed
   - No performance regressions

## Governance

**Constitutional Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices, coding standards, and technical decisions. When conflicts arise, constitutional principles take precedence.

**Amendment Process**:
- Amendments MUST be proposed in writing with clear rationale
- Proposed changes MUST be reviewed by the core development team
- Amendments require consensus approval (no blocking objections)
- All amendments MUST include a migration plan for existing code
- Version number MUST be incremented according to semantic versioning:
  - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removals or redefinitions)
  - **MINOR**: New principles added or material expansions
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance in review checklist
- Deviations from constitutional principles MUST be explicitly justified in the Complexity Tracking section of implementation plans
- Patterns that violate principles require architectural review and formal approval
- Regular audits MUST verify existing code compliance; non-compliant code scheduled for remediation

**Runtime Development Guidance**:
- AI agents and developers MUST reference agent-specific guidance files for implementation details
- Constitution defines "what" and "why"; agent files define "how" for specific technologies
- Template files (plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md) enforce constitutional workflow
