Agents are the foundational building blocks of the ADK-TS framework. They represent autonomous AI programs that can understand instructions, make decisions, use tools, and coordinate with other agents to accomplish complex tasks. Every agent extends from the `BaseAgent` class and implements specific execution patterns for different use cases.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

This section covers everything you need to know about building and working with agents in ADK-TS:

- **Core agent types** - From simple LLM agents to complex multi-agent systems
- **Orchestration patterns** - How to coordinate multiple agents using workflows
- **Agent architecture** - Understanding the base classes and inheritance hierarchy
- **Practical implementation** - Using AgentBuilder for rapid development
- **Advanced patterns** - Custom agents, multi-agent coordination, and specialized behaviors

## Agent Types Overview

ADK-TS provides several agent types, each optimized for specific use cases:

## Understanding Agent Architecture

All agents in ADK-TS follow a common architecture:

- **BaseAgent** - Abstract foundation providing lifecycle management, callbacks, and hierarchy support
- **Agent Hierarchy** - Agents can have sub-agents, creating parent-child relationships for delegation
- **Event-Driven Execution** - Agents communicate through events in the ADK-TS runtime
- **Tool Integration** - Agents can use tools to extend their capabilities beyond text generation

<Callout type="info" title="Key Concepts">
  - **Agent Names** must be unique identifiers (no spaces, start with letter/underscore)
  - **Sub-agents** enable delegation and specialization within your agent system
  - **Callbacks** provide hooks into agent execution for monitoring and control
  - **Sessions** maintain conversation state and memory across agent interactions
</Callout>

## Choosing the Right Agent Type

Selecting the appropriate agent type depends on your specific use case and requirements. Most developers start with **LLM Agents** for conversational AI and reasoning tasks, then move to more specialized types as their needs grow.

**Decision Framework:**

- **Need AI reasoning and conversation?** → **LLM Agent** (most common choice)
- **Sequential processing** → **Sequential Agent** (one step after another)
- **Independent parallel tasks** → **Parallel Agent** (simultaneous execution)
- **Iterative improvement** → **Loop Agent** (retry until success/condition)
- **Complex coordination** → **Multi-Agent System** (specialized roles)
- **Custom business logic** → **Custom Agent** (extend BaseAgent directly)

### Common Patterns by Use Case

The following table maps real-world scenarios to the most appropriate agent types. This helps you quickly identify which agent pattern fits your specific requirements:

| Use Case           | Recommended Agent Type | Why                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Chatbot/Assistant  | LLM Agent              | Conversational AI with reasoning           |
| Data Pipeline      | Sequential Agent       | Step-by-step data processing               |
| Content Generation | Parallel Agent         | Generate multiple pieces simultaneously    |
| Quality Assurance  | Loop Agent             | Iterate until quality standards met        |
| Customer Support   | Multi-Agent            | Route to specialized departments           |
| API Integration    | Custom Agent           | Specific business logic and error handling |

### Development Pattern

Once you've chosen your agent type, most development follows this pattern:

1. **Configure the agent** with models, instructions, and tools
2. **Add sub-agents** if you need specialization or delegation
3. **Test and iterate** using the built-in evaluation tools
4. **Scale up** by adding more agents or switching to multi-agent patterns
