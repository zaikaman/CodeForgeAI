## Test Verification

All tests have been verified to FAIL with the expected error messages:

```
Contract Tests: "App not implemented yet - this is expected (TDD)"
Integration Tests: "Integration test not implemented yet - this is expected (TDD)"
Performance Tests: "Performance test not implemented yet - this is expected (TDD)"
```

This confirms proper TDD setup - tests fail first, then we implement features to make them pass.

---

## Key Metrics

- **Total Test Files**: 15
- **Total Test Cases**: 127+
- **Contract Test Coverage**: 5 API endpoints (onboard, generate, review, enhance, status)
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 7 workflows (4 backend, 2 CLI, 1 frontend)
- **Performance Test Coverage**: 3 categories (onboarding, generation, API latency)

---

## Dependencies Added

- `supertest@^7.0.0` - HTTP assertion library for API testing
- `@types/supertest@^6.0.2` - TypeScript types for supertest

---

## Configuration Updates

**Jest Config** (`backend/jest.config.js`):

- Fixed `coverageThreshold` (was typo `coverageThresholds`)
- Added TypeScript diagnostics config to suppress "unused variable" warnings in TDD placeholder code
- Enabled `warnOnly` mode for diagnostics
- Ignored error code 6133 (declared but never read)

---

## TDD Principle Adherence

✅ **RED**: All tests written and failing  
⏳ **GREEN**: Next phase - implement features to pass tests  
⏳ **REFACTOR**: Clean up implementation after tests pass

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3.3)

1. **Create Data Models** (T031-T039)
   - 8 entity models with Zod validation
   - ProjectContext, Agent, GenerationRequest, CodeOutput, ReviewReport, EnhancementProposal, ToolIntegration, GenerationHistory

2. **Begin Implementation** (Phase 3.4+)
   - Storage layer (lowdb)
   - Core tools (ts-morph, code parsing)
   - Services (embedding, formatting, diff)
   - AI Agents (ADK-TS integration)
   - Workflows (orchestration)
   - API endpoints (Express)
   - CLI commands (Commander.js)
   - Frontend UI (React + Monaco)
   - VS Code extension

---

## Notes

- Security vulnerabilities reduced from 6 → 2 (monaco-editor/dompurify remaining, dev-only)
- All tests use descriptive task IDs (T016, T017, etc.) for traceability
- Tests include both positive and negative cases
- Performance benchmarks align with requirements from quickstart.md
- Frontend tests use Vitest (React testing library compatible)
- Backend tests use Jest (Node.js environment)

**Phase 3.2 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Ready for**: Phase 3.3 (Data Models)
